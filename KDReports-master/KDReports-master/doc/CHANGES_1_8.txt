What is new in KD Reports 1.8
===============================

Features:
---------

Bug fixes:
----------
* TableElement::setDefaultFont() now works as advertised. Each TextElement was forcing its full character format
even if it didn't have a font set. Now each TextElement only sets the parts of the character format that have
been explicitly set, and the default font for every block comes from the report's default font or the table's
default font (in tables).

* The print preview dialog no longer uses the system palette for the default text color (but black instead).
This fixes white-on-white previews when using a dark color scheme. Since it's a print preview, black text
on white background is expected, rather than the system colors.
